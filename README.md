# üï∑Ô∏è Job Crawler Service

This project automates the process of crawling and analyzing job postings from multiple job sites (e.g., Indeed and LinkedIn) using Selenium and custom parsers.

---

## üìå Features

- Automated login and crawling via Selenium WebDriver.
- Modular site-specific parsing using `IJobSiteParser`.
- Intelligent job scoring using `JobAnalyzeService`.
- Deduplication of job records to avoid reprocessing.
- CSV export of stable job listings.
- Configurable crawling target file path.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

The main entry point is:

```csharp
public void Crawl(string filepath = "crawled")
```

### This method:
1. **Reads existing records** from past CSV files to avoid reprocessing duplicate jobs.
2. **Crawls Indeed and LinkedIn** job listings using custom parser implementations:
   - `IndeedJobSiteParser`
   - `LinkedInJobSiteParser`
3. **Deduplicates** and filters new jobs based on ID and existence in previous data.
4. **Enhances each job listing** with detailed content and a relevance score.
5. **Sorts** all jobs by score (descending).
6. **Exports** results to a CSV file (`crawled` by default, or a custom filename).

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- .NET 6 or newer
- Chrome browser installed
- ChromeDriver available in your system path

---

## üìÇ Output Format

The output CSV includes:

- Timestamp
- Job Title
- Company
- Site (e.g., Indeed, LinkedIn)
- Location
- Score
- Link
- Unique ID

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Run the crawler from code like this:

```csharp
using var service = new SelJobCrawlerService();
service.Crawl("output.csv"); // Optional file name
```

---

## üìÅ Configs

- Place `.csv` records from previous runs in the default `FileLibrary.DEFAULT_PATH` directory to enable deduplication.
- You can customize the parsers to target other job sites by implementing `IJobSiteParser`.
